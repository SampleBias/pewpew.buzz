This workflow generates unique, AI-powered images based on user-provided prompts and style preferences, and serves the generated images on a responsive web page.

Example: A user could visit a website that hosts this workflow, enter a prompt like "An astronaut riding a horse in 35mm style" and select a style like "Neon Fauvism", then the workflow would generate a custom image based on those inputs and display it on the webpage.

## What You Can Do
- Allows users to input custom text prompts and select from pre-defined visual styles
- Utilizes the Hugging Face API to generate the images based on the user's inputs
- Automatically uploads the generated images to an S3 storage bucket for hosting
- Serves the generated images on a responsive, mobile-friendly web page with additional context and options
