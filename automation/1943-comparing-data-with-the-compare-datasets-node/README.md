# 1943 Comparing Data With The Compare Datasets Node

Categories: AI, Analytics, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, HR, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow compares two datasets and identifies differences between them, providing a valuable tool for data analysis and reconciliation.

Example: A marketing team might use this workflow to compare customer data from two different sources, such as a CRM system and a marketing automation platform. By identifying discrepancies between the datasets, the team can ensure data accuracy and consistency, leading to more effective marketing campaigns and better decision-making.

## What You Can Do
- Compares two datasets based on a specified field (in this case, the "fruit" field)
- Outputs up to four different branches: items present in both datasets, items only in the first dataset, items only in the second dataset, and items with different values in the two datasets
- Provides a visual representation of the comparison process through the use of sticky notes, making it easy to understand the workflow's functionality

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
