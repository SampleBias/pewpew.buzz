This workflow automatically generates an excuse email and sends it to the original sender, while also notifying the recipient's colleague on Slack.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically generates a random, customized excuse using a spreadsheet of pre-written excuses
- Sends the excuse email to the original recipient, with the subject line and email content dynamically generated
- Notifies the recipient's colleague on Slack, providing the original email content and the generated excuse
