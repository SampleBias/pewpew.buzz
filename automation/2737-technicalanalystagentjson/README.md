# Technical_Analyst_Agent.json

Categories: Analytics

This Telegram-based agent interprets financial questions and stock tickers, performing technical chart analysis using a toolchain that generates TradingView-style charts with MACD and volume indicators. It then provides a visual chart and expert analysis (including candlestick patterns, support/resistance, and MACD insights) directly to the user in an approachable, professional toneâ€”without offering direct financial advice.
