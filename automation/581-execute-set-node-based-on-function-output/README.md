This workflow generates two JSON objects with different IDs, then uses an IF node to conditionally set the value of a "name" field based on the ID.

Example: This workflow could be used to create a simple data transformation process, where the output of the workflow is a JSON object with a "name" field set to either "n8n" or "nodemation" based on the ID of the input data.

## What You Can Do
- Generates two JSON objects with different IDs using a Function node
- Uses an IF node to conditionally set the "name" field based on the ID
- Provides two different output paths with the "name" field set to either "n8n" or "nodemation"

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
