Categories: AI

This workflow turns Telegram messages into an intelligent ‚Äúpersonal-assistant‚Äù conversation powered by GPT-4o; the agent can consult a company knowledge base, look up contacts, calculate, and delegate tasks to dedicated calendar, email, research, projects, and Slack sub-agents. It automatically executes the required tool calls (e.g., send an email, schedule an event, post to Slack) and replies back to you on Telegram with the outcome.
