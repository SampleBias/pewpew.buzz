Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow allows users to set a "Close Date" field and automatically update it based on certain conditions.

Example: A sales team could use this workflow to set a default "Close Date" for new opportunities, and then automatically adjust the date if the opportunity is still open after a certain period of time.

## What You Can Do
- Allows manual triggering of the workflow
- Checks if a "Close Date" field is present and in the correct format
- Automatically sets the "Close Date" to 3 weeks in the future if the original date is not valid
- Provides an option to reset the "Close Date" to the original value

1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
