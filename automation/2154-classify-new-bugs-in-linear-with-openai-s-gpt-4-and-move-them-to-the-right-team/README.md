This workflow automatically classifies new bug tickets in a Linear project and assigns them to the appropriate team for resolution.

Example: A software development team uses this workflow to streamline their bug tracking and resolution process. Whenever a new bug is reported in Linear, the workflow analyzes the ticket details, identifies the relevant team based on the issue's description and labels, and then updates the ticket's team assignment accordingly. This ensures that bugs are routed to the right team for efficient resolution.
