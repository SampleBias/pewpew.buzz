This workflow automates the process of capturing and storing expense receipts, providing valuable insights for expense tracking and management.

Example: A small business owner can use this workflow to streamline their expense reporting process. Whenever an employee submits an expense receipt, the workflow automatically extracts the key details (category, date, amount, etc.) and stores them in an Airtable database. The workflow also generates a summary message that can be shared with the employee, providing transparency and accountability.
