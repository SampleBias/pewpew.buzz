This workflow orchestrates the asynchronous execution of multiple sub-workflows and waits for them to complete before continuing the main workflow.

Example: This workflow could be used to process multiple requests in parallel, such as sending notifications or updating records in a database, and then consolidate the results before taking further action.

## What You Can Do
- Starts multiple sub-workflows in parallel using a webhook
- Waits for all sub-workflows to complete before continuing the main workflow
- Tracks the completion status of each sub-workflow to ensure all have finished before proceeding

1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
