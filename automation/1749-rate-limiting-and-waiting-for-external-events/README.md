Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Customer Support, Ecommerce, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow sends personalized messages to customers, waits for external approval, and then continues with the rest of the workflow.

Example: This workflow could be used in a customer service or sales process where you need to send a message to a customer, wait for their approval or response, and then continue with the next steps in the process.

## What You Can Do
- Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming external services with too many requests at once
- Waiting for an external event (such as a customer clicking an approval link) before continuing the workflow
- Sending personalized messages to customers based on data from a customer datastore

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
