Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow executes a command that returns a JSON object, parses the output, and then uses an if-statement to conditionally process the data.

Example: This workflow could be used to process the output of a command that checks the status of a system or service. If the output indicates a specific condition is met (e.g., a value is true), the workflow can then perform additional actions based on that condition.

## What You Can Do

- Parses the command output as a JSON object
- Conditionally processes the data based on the value of a specific field
