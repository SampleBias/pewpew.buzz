Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Customer Support, Ecommerce, Engineering, HR, IT, Project Management, Social Media, Webhooks

This workflow is designed to create and manage embeddings for a WordPress website's content, enabling a conversational AI agent to provide relevant information to website visitors based on their questions.

Example: A website owner can use this workflow to automatically generate embeddings for their WordPress content, including blog posts and pages. The workflow can be set to run on a regular schedule to update the embeddings as new content is added or existing content is modified. When a website visitor asks a question, the workflow retrieves the relevant content from the Supabase vector store, generates an AI-powered response using the OpenAI language model, and sends the response back to the visitor through a webhook.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically generates embeddings for WordPress content and stores them in a Supabase vector store
- Provides a conversational AI agent that can answer visitor questions based on the website's content
- Integrates metadata (such as URL, publication date, and modification date) directly into the AI agent's responses to provide context
- Supports incremental updates to the vector store, ensuring that new and updated content is included in the AI agent's knowledge base
