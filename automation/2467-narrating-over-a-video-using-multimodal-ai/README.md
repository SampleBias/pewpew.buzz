# 2467 Narrating Over A Video Using Multimodal Ai

Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow takes a video, extracts frames from it, and uses a multimodal language model to generate a narration script, which is then used to create a voiceover clip that is uploaded to Google Drive.

Example: A content creator wants to add a professional-sounding voiceover to a video they've created. They can use this workflow to automatically generate a narration script based on the video's visuals and then have the script converted into an audio file that can be added to the final video.

## What You Can Do
- Extracts evenly distributed frames from a video using OpenCV
- Generates a narration script for the video using a multimodal language model
- Combines the partial scripts into a full script and uses OpenAI's text-to-speech capabilities to create a voiceover audio file
- Uploads the final voiceover clip to Google Drive for easy access and integration into the video
