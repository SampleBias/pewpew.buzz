# 2312 Attach A Default Error Handler To All Active Workflows

Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Email, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow automatically updates the error handling configuration for active n8n workflows that do not have a custom error handler set.

Example: Imagine you have a team of developers working on various n8n workflows. Over time, some of these workflows may not have a custom error handler configured, leaving you vulnerable to unhandled errors. This workflow runs daily to identify these workflows and automatically update their error handling configuration to a predefined "default error handler" workflow, ensuring your team's workflows are properly monitored and errors are handled consistently.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically identifies active n8n workflows without a custom error handler set
- Updates the error handling configuration for these workflows to use a predefined "default error handler" workflow
- Sends an email notification when a workflow fails, providing the workflow name and a link to the failed execution
- Runs on a daily schedule to proactively maintain your n8n workflows' error handling setup

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
