# 2140 Add Product Ideas To Notion Via A Slack Command

Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Customer Support, Ecommerce, Engineering, HR, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow allows Slack users to submit new ideas to a Notion database by using a Slack slash command, and provides a helpful message with instructions for adding more details to the idea.

Example: A team using this workflow can set up a Slack integration that allows their employees to submit new product or feature ideas by typing `/idea` in a Slack channel. The workflow then automatically creates a new page in a Notion database with the idea details, and sends a message back to the user with a link to add more information about the idea.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates Slack and Notion to streamline the idea submission process
- Provides a helpful message to the user with instructions for adding more details to the idea
- Easily extensible to support additional Slack commands (e.g., `/bug`, `/pain`) for different types of submissions
