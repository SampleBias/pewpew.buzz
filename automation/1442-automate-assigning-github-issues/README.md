Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Dev Ops, Ecommerce, Engineering, HR, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow automatically assigns GitHub issues to the issue creator or the commenter who requests to work on the issue, helping to streamline the issue management process.

Example: A software development team using GitHub for project management can set up this workflow to automatically assign new issues to the issue creator or a team member who expresses interest in working on the issue. This helps ensure that issues are quickly assigned and addressed, improving overall team productivity.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically assigns issues to the issue creator if the issue is unassigned and the issue body contains the phrase "assign me"
- Automatically assigns issues to the commenter who requests to work on the issue by including "assign me" in their comment
- Provides a friendly comment to the commenter if the issue is already assigned to someone else
