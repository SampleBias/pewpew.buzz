# 1746 Filtering And Branching Data

Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow filters and routes customer data based on various conditions, providing a flexible way to manage customer information.

Example: A sales team could use this workflow to segment their customer base and tailor their outreach efforts. For instance, they could send targeted promotions to US-based customers, follow up with customers from Colorado, and handle UK-based customers differently.

## What You Can Do
- Conditional filtering using "If" nodes with AND/OR logic
- Multi-branch routing based on country using a "Switch" node
- Ability to handle various data conditions, such as empty country or name containing "Max"

1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
