Categories: Data Management, Email, Content Creation

This JARVIS agent acts as a universal personal assistant that routes user requests to the correct specialized workflow toolsâ€”like email, calendar, contacts, blog content creation, or web search. It uses OpenAI for intent detection and decision-making, ensuring actions are delegated without handling any content creation directly.
