# n8n_Excuse_Generator.json

Categories: Webhooks

The n8n Excuse Generator workflow receives a problem and desired tone via a webhook, uses GPT-4o-mini to generate a clever excuse tailored to that tone, and sends the result back through a webhook response. It supports tones like realistic, funny, ridiculous, and outrageous, returning a concise, humorous excuse in 1â€“3 sentences.
