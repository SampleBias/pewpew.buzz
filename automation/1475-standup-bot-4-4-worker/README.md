This workflow manages a Mattermost-based standup process, allowing users to configure and update their standup settings, and providing reminders and reporting capabilities.

Example: A team using Mattermost for their daily standups can use this workflow to set up and customize their standup process. Users can use a slash command to open a configuration dialog, where they can specify the standup title, time, days, questions, and participants. The workflow then sends reminders to the relevant users and collects their responses, which are then posted in a summary report to the team's Mattermost channel.

## What You Can Do
