# Apify.json

Categories: Data Management

This flow triggers the Apify “Google Maps Extractor” actor via HTTP POST, pauses just long enough for the crawl to finish, and then pulls the dataset of places it found. Sticky-note blocks provide setup tips—including a 30 % discount code—and optional nodes for running the actor synchronously if you’d rather skip the wait.

## Technical Details

This workflow consists of 9 nodes that work together to automate your process. Here's what it uses:

- httpRequest: Get Results, Google Maps Actor, Sync Run
- stickyNote: Sticky Note, Sticky Note1, Sticky Note2, Sticky Note3, Sticky Note4
- wait: Wait
