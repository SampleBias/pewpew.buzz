# 2538 Demo Workflow How To Use Workflowstaticdata

Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Ecommerce, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow manages the expiration and renewal of an access token, ensuring continuous access to a protected API.

Example: This workflow could be used by a web application that needs to access a third-party API that requires an access token. The workflow automatically checks if the current access token is still valid, and if not, it retrieves a new token and stores it in the workflow's static data for future use.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic access token management: The workflow checks the expiration of the access token and retrieves a new one when necessary.
- Persistent storage of access token: The workflow uses the `workflowStaticData()` function to store the access token and its expiration timestamp, ensuring the token is available across workflow executions.
- Scheduled trigger: The workflow can be triggered on a schedule (e.g., every hour) to proactively check and renew the access token.
