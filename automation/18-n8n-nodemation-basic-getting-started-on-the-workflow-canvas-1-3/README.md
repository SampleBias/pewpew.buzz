This workflow periodically executes a custom function that sets two variables, and then uses the Set node to extract one of those variables and store it in the workflow's data.

Example: This workflow could be used to periodically generate and store a dynamic value, such as a timestamp or a random number, that can be used in other parts of the workflow or shared with other systems.

## What You Can Do
- Executes a custom function every 2 hours to generate dynamic data
- Stores a specific variable from the function's output in the workflow's data
- Can be easily integrated with other nodes or systems to utilize the generated data

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
