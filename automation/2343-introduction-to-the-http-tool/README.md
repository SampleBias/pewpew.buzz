This workflow allows users to interact with an AI agent that can scrape web pages and suggest activities based on user input.

Example: A user could use this workflow to get the latest 10 issues from the n8n GitHub repository, and then ask the AI agent to suggest an educational or recreational activity they could do based on their mood and preferences.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates with OpenAI's language model to enable natural language interactions with the AI agent
- Utilizes an HTTP request node to easily fetch data from web APIs, reducing the complexity of the workflow
- Provides a sticky note feature to display helpful information and instructions for users

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
