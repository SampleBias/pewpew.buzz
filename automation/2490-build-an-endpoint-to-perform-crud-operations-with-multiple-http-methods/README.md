This workflow provides a comprehensive customer management system, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete customer records in an Airtable database through a set of webhooks.

Example: A small business owner could use this workflow to manage their customer database. They can create new customer records, retrieve all existing customers, update customer information, and even delete records as needed, all through a simple webhook interface.

## What You Can Do
- Webhook-based interface for easy integration with external systems
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer records in Airtable
- Customizable response codes and payloads for each operation
- Sticky notes providing clear documentation on the purpose of each node

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
