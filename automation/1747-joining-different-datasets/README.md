Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow demonstrates various use cases of the Merge node in n8n, allowing users to combine and enrich data from different sources.

Example: A chef might use this workflow to manage their recipe ingredients. The workflow can keep track of which ingredients are in stock, enrich the recipe data with the required quantities, and even create a "super band" by merging data from two different music groups.

## What You Can Do
- Merging data based on matching fields (similar to SQL joins)
- Enriching data by combining information from multiple sources
- Combining data from different sources (similar to SQL Union All)

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!
