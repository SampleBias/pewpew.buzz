This workflow uses Gemini 2.0's prompt-based object detection capabilities to identify and draw bounding boxes around rabbits in an image.

Example: A user might use this workflow to quickly identify and highlight the locations of specific objects (e.g., rabbits, cars, people) within an image, which could be useful for tasks like visual search, content moderation, or image analysis.

## What You Can Do
- Prompt-based object detection using Gemini 2.0 API
- Automatic scaling of bounding box coordinates to fit the original image size
- Visualization of detected objects by drawing bounding boxes on the image
