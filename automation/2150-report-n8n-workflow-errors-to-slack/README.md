This workflow is designed to automatically send a Slack notification when an error occurs in a production workflow, providing valuable information to the team for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.

Example: Imagine you have a critical workflow that runs in your production environment, processing important data or triggering key business processes. If this workflow encounters an error, this error handling workflow would automatically send a Slack message to a designated channel, alerting the team to the issue and providing details about the error, the workflow name, and a link to the execution details. This allows the team to quickly identify and address the problem, minimizing downtime and ensuring the smooth operation of your business.
