Categories: AI, Analytics, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow integrates an AI agent with the ability to generate charts using OpenAI's structured output capabilities, providing a seamless way to incorporate data visualizations into conversational AI applications.

Example: A user could engage with the AI agent and request a chart related to a specific topic, such as "Can you show me a chart of the top 5 movies at the box office?" The agent would then call a tool that triggers a sub-workflow to generate a chart definition using OpenAI's structured output, which is then converted into a Quickchart.io URL and returned to the agent to display the chart in the conversation.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates an AI agent with the ability to generate charts on-demand
- Leverages OpenAI's structured output capabilities to generate chart definitions that adhere to Quickchart.io specifications
- Provides a seamless user experience by embedding the chart directly into the conversational interface
