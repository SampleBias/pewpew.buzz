Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Webhooks

This workflow helps identify potentially affected workflows and nodes in an n8n instance after upgrading to version 0.214.3, where some workflows might have been re-wired incorrectly due to changes in nodes with more than one output.

Example: After upgrading your n8n instance to version 0.214.3, you can use this workflow to quickly identify any workflows that might have been affected by the migration. This allows you to inspect and fix those workflows, ensuring your automation processes continue to work as expected.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically scans all workflows in the n8n instance and identifies those with potentially affected nodes
- Provides a detailed report that lists the affected workflows and the specific nodes that might have been impacted
- Allows you to easily access and inspect the affected workflows directly from the report

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
