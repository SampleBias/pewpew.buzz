This workflow automatically searches for and downloads torrent files based on a title received via a webhook, and sends notifications to a Telegram chat.

Example: A user could use this workflow to automatically download movies or TV shows they want to watch, by sending a request to the workflow's webhook with the title of the content they want to download.
