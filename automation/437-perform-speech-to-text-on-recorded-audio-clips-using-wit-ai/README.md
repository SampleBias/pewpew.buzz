Categories: AI, Marketing, Data Management, Content Creation, Engineering, IT, Project Management, Social Media, Webhooks

This workflow converts a local audio file into a format suitable for processing by a speech recognition API, allowing users to transcribe audio content.

Example: A marketing team could use this workflow to automatically transcribe audio recordings of customer interviews, enabling them to quickly identify key insights and feedback without manually listening to the full recordings.

## What You Can Do
- Reads a binary audio file from a local file path
- Sends the audio data to a speech recognition API (in this case, Wit.ai) using an HTTP POST request
- Handles the necessary headers and content types to ensure the API can properly process the audio data

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
